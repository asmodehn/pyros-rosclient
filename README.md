# pyros-rosclient
Package to use Pyros as a ROS client to other multiprocess architecture ( Web or others )

The location & name & structure of this repo might change soon. It's still in early development and quite unstable.

In particular we need to find out how to mix and match:

- existing pyros
- ros extensions for pyros (as opposed to zmp extensions for example)
- library to easily build ros-web client (and zmp-web ?)
- test for a ros-web client using httpbin
- gopher software application (for yujinrobot)
